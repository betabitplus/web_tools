# Test File Template

## Overview

Use this template for non-e2e pytest files under `tests/`.

This is the shared file-shape reference for:

- unit tests
- integration tests
- property-based tests

Use the e2e-specific template only for replay-backed scenario scripts under
`tests/.../e2e/`.

Use the Python docstring pattern from `references/core/docstring_template.md`.

## When To Use

Use this template when the file is a normal pytest module rather than an
executable e2e scenario or a live workbench script.

Use this template when you want one consistent shape for fast deterministic
tests, controlled integration checks, or invariant-driven generated tests.

## File Shape

Keep this top-level order, using only the sections the file genuinely needs:

1. file header docstring
2. imports
3. fixed `pytestmark` or module-level config when needed
4. `Scenario` or `Strategies`
5. `Fixtures`
6. `Helpers`
7. `Assertions`
8. `Properties` and/or `Tests`

## Standard Section Titles

Use only these top-level section titles when they are needed:

- `Scenario`
- `Strategies`
- `Fixtures`
- `Helpers`
- `Assertions`
- `Properties`
- `Tests`

## Rules

- Use only the sections the file genuinely needs.
- Keep shared fixtures and builders out of the file when they belong in
  top-level `py_lib_tooling` helpers or `tests/<project>/support/`.
- Keep `Assertions` readable as a short walkthrough of the public rule being
  protected.
- Keep `Properties` before `Tests` when the file mixes generated checks with
  named examples.

## Section Notes

`Scenario` holds fixed example inputs, expected outputs, or named boundary
cases. Prefer it for unit or integration files with explicit cases.

`Strategies` holds Hypothesis strategies and related generated-input helpers.
Prefer it for property-based files. Keep the generated domain meaningful and
small enough to shrink well.

`Fixtures` holds local pytest fixtures that are specific to the file. Shared
cross-project fixtures and helpers should come from top-level `py_lib_tooling`
in starter-shaped py-lib repos; package-specific builders should live under
`tests/<project>/support/` instead.

`Helpers` holds small builders, formatters, comparison helpers, and local
support code that make the test bodies read clearly.

`Assertions` should read like a short walkthrough. Add short comments when the
check is not obvious so the reader can see what public rule is being protected
and why it matters.

For non-obvious tests, add a bit more comment guidance than you would in a
tiny unit test so the file reads like a compact assertion walkthrough rather
than a bare assertion dump. When choosing between ultra-minimal comments and a
few short useful "why" comments, prefer the latter.

`Properties` is for invariant-driven generated tests. Use it when the file has
Hypothesis-driven checks and you want those properties to be easy to scan
separately from named examples.

Property-based files usually need a bit more commentary than example-only
files because generated inputs can hide test intent if the invariant is not
explained clearly. Prefer a few extra intent comments over making the reader
reverse-engineer the property from the assertions alone.

`Tests` is for ordinary example-based pytest cases. Use it for named boundary
checks, narrow regressions, or small integration flows.

If a file mixes generated properties with named examples, keep both sections in
that order: `Properties` first, then `Tests`.

If a standard section would otherwise be empty, omit it instead of keeping a
decorative placeholder.

## Layer Notes

For unit tests:

- prefer pure functions, public DTOs, and small deterministic boundaries
- avoid broad environment setup
- for public config behavior, import from the top-level package and cover
  install/read behavior, non-config `TypeError`, and cache invalidation when
  runtime objects capture installed snapshots

For integration tests:

- keep the test focused on one meaningful collaboration boundary
- prefer public interfaces and realistic construction over mocking every layer

For property-based tests:

- keep public-contract property files separate from internal property files
- for public-contract property files, keep the invariant public and stable
- for public-contract property files, import only from the supported top-level
  package boundary
- for public-contract property files, do not import `_internal` modules
- for internal property files, keep the private invariant explicit and place
  the file in a separate internal property group instead of mixing it with
  public-contract files
- generate valid inputs intentionally instead of producing random invalid noise

## Template

Use the file below as the reference layout.

```python
"""Example deterministic and generated verification file.

Why:
    Protects stable public behavior with a mix of generated invariants and
    small named boundary examples.

Covers:
    Area: public request helpers
    Behavior: omission semantics, preserved explicit values
    Interface: public DTO construction and expansion helpers

Checks:
    If callers pass explicit non-null values, then those values are preserved.
    If callers omit optional values, then those values stay omitted.
    If callers pass named invalid inputs, then validation fails at the public
    boundary.
