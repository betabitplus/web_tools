# E2E Test Template

## Overview

Use this template for executable Python e2e test files.

Use the e2e-specific docstring pattern from
`references/core/docstring_template.md`.

## When To Use

Use this template for executable e2e test files under `tests/.../e2e/`.

When the project uses `architecture/concepts/` as the primary vertical-slice
grouping, keep each e2e script in the concept-aligned folder for the slice it
proves.

## File Shape

Keep this top-level order in every file:

1. file header docstring
2. imports
3. `pytestmark`
4. `Scenario`
5. `Helpers`
6. `Pipeline`
7. `Assertions`
8. `Tests`
9. `Demo (Manual Execution)`

## Standard Section Titles

Use only these top-level section titles:

- `Scenario`
- `Helpers`
- `Pipeline`
- `Assertions`
- `Tests`
- `Demo (Manual Execution)`

## Core Rules (Testing)

- Use `references/verification/tests_routing_pattern.md` for test tree placement.
- Hermetic replay for external API calls.
- Import product behavior only from the product's public top-level package in
  e2e tests. Shared test infrastructure may come from top-level
  `py_lib_tooling`.
- Do not patch or monkeypatch library internals in e2e tests.
- Test-only helpers and setup must live under `tests/`, never under `src/`.
- Tests should validate public behavior, not internal implementation details.
- `main()` must run live.
- Demo runs must never replay or record VCR traffic.
- If a live demo and a replayed pytest run would produce different behavior,
  the test is wrong and must be fixed.
- Put assertions in a dedicated helper instead of spreading them through the test body.
- Keep `main()` close to the actual test flow.
- `Demo (Manual Execution)` must semantically mirror the `Assertions` section.
- Manual demo output must expose the same meaningful scenario result and verification-relevant details a human would need to confirm the test really succeeded.
- If a file asserts multiple meaningful scenarios or public outcomes, `main()` must show each of them, or clearly show an equivalent success and failure shape for every asserted behavior category.
- Manual demo output should read like a short narrative for a non-specialist reader: what is being tested, why it matters, what happened step by step, and why the result counts as success.
- Prefer readable explanation over raw logs. Keep technical evidence, but frame it with enough context that a PM can understand the scenario without opening the code.
- pytest-based hermetic runs replay committed cassettes.
- recording or forced replay is enabled explicitly.
- Runnable e2e scripts must also work in already-running loop environments.
- Async test entrypoints must use the top-level
  `py_lib_tooling.run_async(...)` helper instead of calling
  `asyncio.run(...)` directly in starter-shaped py-lib repos.

## Rules

- Keep the top-level section order fixed.
- Write docstring `Checks` lines in explicit `If <condition>, then <consequence>.`
  form so the proving condition and the expected outcome stay obvious.
- Make docstring `Checks` cover every meaningful assertion or assertion
  cluster from the file's `Assertions` section.
- Keep `Assertions` readable as a short walkthrough rather than a silent
  predicate dump.
- Keep empty standard sections explicit with a short one-line note instead of
  silently implying missing layout.
- Run executable e2e files in module mode so shared setup comes from
  `tests.<project>.e2e`.

## Section Notes

`Scenario` holds all fixed case data. Put the real inputs first, then expected
outputs, output paths, or other fixed expectations.

`Assertions` should read like a short walkthrough, not a silent pile of
predicates. For non-obvious scenarios, add short comments that explain what
each assertion is proving and why that check matters.

`Helpers`, `Pipeline`, `Tests`, and `Demo (Manual Execution)` should follow the
same idea when the scenario is not obvious. A reader should be able to follow
the intended failure, recovery, or boundary behavior without reverse-engineering
the whole file.

If a standard section would otherwise be empty, keep the section and make that
explicit with a short one-line note.

Example:

```python
# =============================================================================
# Helpers
# =============================================================================

# No local helpers for this scenario.
```

Very short assertion-style illustration:

```python
def assert_pipeline_response(response: ImageReport) -> None:
    # First prove the title is really present.
    assert response.title.strip()

    # Then prove the summary is not an empty stub.
    assert response.summary.strip()

    # Finally, check the exact normalized tag count the scenario promises.
    assert len(normalize_tags(response.tags)) == _EXPECTED_TAG_COUNT
```

Very short full-flow illustration:

```python
def run_pipeline(*, image_path: Path) -> ImageReport:
    # This is the one public call the scenario is really about.
    return analyze_image(
        image_path=image_path,
        instructions=_INSTRUCTIONS,
        schema=ImageReport,
    )


def test_pipeline() -> None:
    # First run the public flow exactly as a user would.
    response = run_pipeline(image_path=_INPUT_IMAGE)

    # Then validate the contract in one dedicated assertion helper.
    assert_pipeline_response(response)
```

## Template

Use the file below as the reference layout.

```python
# %%
"""Image analysis workflow e2e.

Why:
    Verifies that the public image-analysis entry point accepts an image input
    and returns normalized structured output.

Covers:
    Area: image analysis workflow
    Behavior: image input, structured output
    Interface: public function call with schema-driven output

Checks:
    If the public call succeeds, then the response contains a non-empty title
    and summary.
    If the structured output is normalized correctly, then the response
    returns exactly 3 normalized tags.

Notes:
    Add only when runtime prerequisites or live-run caveats matter.

Examples:
    Run manually:
        uv run python -m tests.project.e2e.group.test_file

    Run as test:
        pytest path/to/test_file.py
