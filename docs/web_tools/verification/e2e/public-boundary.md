# Public Boundary E2E

## Overview

This e2e slice proves the baseline package can install and read a runtime
config snapshot through the supported top-level public API.

## Proof

### Scenario

[test_public_config_pipeline.py](../../../../tests/web_tools/e2e/public_boundary/test_public_config_pipeline.py)
runs the public config lifecycle through `web_tools`.

### Checks

If a caller installs a config snapshot, then `get_config()` returns the same
public snapshot through the supported top-level import boundary.

Would fail if:

- config facade exports stopped resolving through the top-level package
- config installation no longer updated the active runtime snapshot
- the e2e test needed private imports to prove public behavior
